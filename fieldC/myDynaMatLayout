/*
 * the original code wrote out the intensity and the field params from
 * 'field2dyna', but I'm going to do it here. the file will be:
 *
 * int numNodes
 *
 * intensity, numNodes doubles
 *
 * fieldParams:
 *
 *  int threads
 *  int soundSpeed
 *  int samplingFrequency
 *  double alpha
 *  double fnum
 *  point_type focus (struct of three doubles)
 *  double frequency
 *  length of transducer character string, int
 *  transducer, character string
 *  length of impulse character string, int
 *  impulse, character string
 *  pointsAndNodes, which is numNodes nodeEntry structs (one int,
 *      three doubles)
 *  int ROWS * no_elements * no_sub_y
 *  ThData, which is ROWS * no_elements * no_sub_y doubles. ROWS is a constant
 *      determined by the return of 'xdc_get, and no_elements, no_sub_y come
 *      from the probe description file. in our case, it appears that we only
 *      care about rectangles.
